# Pipeline-for-smORF-classification

Genomes harbor an enormous number of Open Reading Frames (ORFs); however, determining which ones will be translated is not trivial, complicating the process of annotating protein-coding sequences. This challenge becomes more pronounced as the size of the ORFs decreases. The use of modern sequencing and proteomic technologies has allowed the observation that many organisms present small Open Reading Frames (smORFs) that are actively transcribed and translated. These smORFs have the potential to encode small-sized polypeptides, known as SEPs (SmORFs Encoded Polypeptides). 

It has been demonstrated that SEPs are involved in a wide range of processes in bacteria. However there is no much information on these genes in a large group of bacterias such as Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR), most of the bacterial plant pathogens, and certain genera responsible for causing diverse diseases in animals.
